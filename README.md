Nio is an upcoming matrix client for iOS.

For the time being this project is still very much a work in progress. For updates, please check by in our matrix room â†’ [#niochat:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#niochat:matrix.org).

Want to give it a spin? Join the public [TestFlight Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/KlXr3kKz).

### Getting Started

The following steps should be all that's necessary to build Nio with Xcode.

***Note***: Please be aware that Nio builds against the iOS 14 SDK and thus currently requires the Xcode 12 Beta. Download a copy from [Apple's Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/download).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/niochat/nio.git
$ cd nio
$ pod install
$ xed .
```

### Why "Nio"?

*Nio* is short for *Niobe* (albeit pronounced differently), captain of the ship *Logos* in the [Matrix trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)). Additionally it's a homonym of *Neo*, because there's definitely not enough Matrix projects jumping on that pun train already.

The abbreviation NIO is also commonly used to refer to the term *non-blocking IO*. I find this entertaining for a messaging client, which is essentially a human IO interface.
